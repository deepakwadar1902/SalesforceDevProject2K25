Let's break down the flow of the code, step-by-step, from the **parent component** to the **child component**, and how data and events are passed between them.

### Step-by-Step Code Flow

#### 1. **Parent Component Loads Data (Initial State)**
When the **Parent Component** (`parentComponent`) loads:

- The **Apex method** `getAccounts` is called via the `@wire` service to retrieve a list of **Account** records from Salesforce. This is executed automatically when the component is loaded.
- The result of `getAccounts` is assigned to the `accounts` property. This data will be an array of `Account` records, which will contain fields like `Id` and `Name`.

```javascript
@wire(getAccounts)
wiredAccounts({ error, data }) {
    if (data) {
        this.accounts = data; // Store accounts data in the component
    } else if (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching accounts:', error);
    }
}
```

At this point, the component has the list of **Account** records in `this.accounts`. 

#### 2. **Parent Component Displays Account List**
In the **HTML** of the parent component (`parentComponent.html`):

- A `lightning-button` is dynamically rendered for each account in the `accounts` array. The `label` of the button is the account's `Name`, and the `data-id` attribute is set to the `account.Id`.
- When any account button is clicked, the `handleAccountSelect` method is triggered.

```html
<template for:each={accounts} for:item="account">
    <lightning-button 
        key={account.Id} 
        label={account.Name} 
        onclick={handleAccountSelect} 
        data-id={account.Id}>
    </lightning-button>
</template>
```

- The `data-id={account.Id}` stores the unique Salesforce Account ID for each button. This ID is used when selecting an account.

#### 3. **User Clicks on an Account Button (Interaction)**
When a user clicks on any of the rendered `lightning-button` elements:

- The `handleAccountSelect` method is triggered.
- Inside `handleAccountSelect`, the `event.target.dataset.id` is used to retrieve the `accountId` of the clicked button. The `data-id` attribute, which was set to the account's ID, is captured by `event.target.dataset.id`.

```javascript
handleAccountSelect(event) {
    this.selectedAccountId = event.target.dataset.id; // Get the Account Id from the button
    console.log('Selected Account Id:', this.selectedAccountId);  // Debugging log
}
```

- The selected `accountId` is stored in the `selectedAccountId` property of the **parent component**.

#### 4. **Pass Account ID to Child Component**
Now that the `selectedAccountId` has been set in the parent component, this value is passed to the **child component** (`childComponent`) via an **attribute** (`account-id`).

```html
<c-child-component 
    account-id={selectedAccountId} 
    onaccountviewed={handleAccountViewed}>
</c-child-component>
```

- The parent passes `selectedAccountId` (the Account Id) as a property to the child using the `account-id={selectedAccountId}` syntax. This makes the selected `accountId` available in the **child component** via the `@api` decorator.

#### 5. **Child Component Receives Account ID**
In the **child component** (`childComponent`), the `accountId` is declared as a property using the `@api` decorator. This makes it **reactive** and ensures the child component gets updated when the parent passes new data.

```javascript
@api accountId;  // Receives Account Id from the parent
```

- Whenever the `account-id` value changes in the parent component, the child automatically updates its `accountId` property.

In the **child component’s `connectedCallback()` method**, we log the received `accountId` for debugging purposes to ensure it is passed correctly.

```javascript
connectedCallback() {
    console.log('Received Account Id in child component:', this.accountId);
}
```

- At this point, the child component now has the `accountId` and can render the associated account details.

#### 6. **Child Component Renders the "Mark as Viewed" Button**
The **child component** checks if the `accountId` has been passed. If it exists, it renders a **"Mark as Viewed"** button.

```html
<template if:true={accountId}>
    <p>Account ID: {accountId}</p>
    <lightning-button label="Mark as Viewed" onclick={handleButtonClick}></lightning-button>
</template>
<template if:false={accountId}>
    <p>No account selected.</p>
</template>
```

- The `lightning-button` is rendered only if the `accountId` is truthy (i.e., if it’s a valid `accountId`).

#### 7. **User Clicks "Mark as Viewed" Button in Child Component**
When the user clicks the **"Mark as Viewed"** button, the `handleButtonClick()` method in the **child component** is executed.

```javascript
handleButtonClick() {
    const event = new CustomEvent('accountviewed', {
        detail: { accountId: this.accountId }  // Passing accountId to parent
    });
    this.dispatchEvent(event);  // Dispatch the custom event
}
```

- A custom event `accountviewed` is dispatched. This event carries the `accountId` in its `detail` property.

#### 8. **Parent Component Receives Event**
The **parent component** listens for the `accountviewed` event from the child component.

```html
<c-child-component 
    account-id={selectedAccountId} 
    onaccountviewed={handleAccountViewed}>
</c-child-component>
```

- When the `accountviewed` event is fired from the child, the `handleAccountViewed` method in the **parent component** is triggered.

```javascript
handleAccountViewed(event) {
    const viewedAccountId = event.detail.accountId;  // Retrieve the Account Id from event
    console.log('Account viewed with Id:', viewedAccountId);  // Log the account Id
}
```

- The `event.detail.accountId` contains the `accountId` from the child, and it’s logged or can be used for further processing.

---

### Summary of Flow:

1. **Parent Component** fetches **Account records** from Salesforce.
2. Each **Account** is rendered as a button with the `accountId` stored in the `data-id` attribute.
3. The user **clicks on an Account button**, triggering the `handleAccountSelect` method.
4. The parent sets the selected `accountId` and passes it to the **child component** via the `account-id` attribute.
5. The **child component** receives the `accountId`, and the **"Mark as Viewed"** button is displayed.
6. When the user clicks the **"Mark as Viewed"** button in the child, a custom event is dispatched to the parent with the selected `accountId`.
7. The **parent component** listens for the event and handles it in the `handleAccountViewed` method.

This flow allows **bidirectional communication** between the parent and child components using **properties** and **custom events** in Salesforce Lightning Web Components (LWC).
